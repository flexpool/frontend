title: What is unpaid balance? How payouts are processed?
---

Flexpool does not pay to the Ethereum wallet continuously. Since every transaction has a static fee no matter the transaction value, it is better to batch funds in bigger values; hence, paying less transaction fees.

To save the most on fees, we recommend you have the highest payout limit possible.
