title: My balance has frozen for a long time. Have I configured my mining software properly?

Yes, everything is good unless you cannot see your workers on the dashboard page. As we are not the largest mining pool, we don't find blocks every minute. During unlucky periods, your balance may stall for some time.

No need to worry in this case. The right explanation for this would be "The balance updates each time we mine a block," rather than "The rewards are given when we mine a block" since our reward system still holds your "pending" block share even though balance is not moving.
