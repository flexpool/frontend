title: What does ZIL warning mean?
coin: eth
---

The ZIL warning on the settings screen does not apply to you unless you are split-mining ETH and ZIL to a proxy pool like Rustpool, or otherwise using a proxy. If you do not specifically set up a proxy or configure split-mining, it does not apply to you. Ignore it unless you are doing that.
