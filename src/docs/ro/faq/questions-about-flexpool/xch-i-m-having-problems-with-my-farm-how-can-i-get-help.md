Chia is a more complicated platform to troubleshoot. We recommend checking the [Chia troubleshooting guide on our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flexpool/comments/oocdv5/basic_troubleshooting_for_pooling_chia_with/). Once you have checked those possible issues, you may either join our Telegram or Discord servers and get help from the community and the pool team, visit [r/Flexpool](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flexpool) or [r/chia](https://www.reddit.com/r/chia) on Reddit, or find the "Help" or "Chat" button at the bottom right of any page on our website to get 1:1 support from our support team
