title: How to join Flexpool Chia pool?
coin: xch

With your Chia Network software, join the pool using one of our pool addresses on [Getting Started](https://www.flexpool.io/get-started). Within about an hour (100-110 blocks) your join will be complete. You must use a PlotNFT and plots made with a PlotNFT pool contract address; OG plots (made before Chia 1.2.0) or solo plots (not made with a PlotNFT) cannot be used for the pool.
