title: Does Flexpool make weekly payouts regardless of the balance?
---

**No**. We don't do weekly payouts if your balance is below your payout limit. Doing this will require "wasting" some space in our blocks, and it is known to decrease miners' profits. We are not doing that, and will never do in the future because miners' earnings are in #1 priority for us.
