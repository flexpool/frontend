title: What is Share Difficulty?
level: intermediate

Technically, shares are the same blocks, but just with modified (reduced in this case) difficulty. Your workers are mining those shares, and it is important for them to be easy to find. Otherwise, it would be impossible for pool to track worker statistics and verify that it is actually mining, not just sending unproven hashrate reports.
