title: Why does my GUI show current difficulty of 1 and current points balance of 9999?

These are both normal for our pool.

Because of the way points and partials are handled on the back end, we use a static difficulty of 1. This enables more consistent estimated statistics, and does not adversely affect farmers' hard drives.

The points balance isn't used on our pool, so if you see 9999, that just says you have reached our pool successfully. The "Points Found in Last 24 Hours" number should equate to the numbers on our dashboard, and the "Points Successful in Last 24 Hours" number should be pretty close to the percentage of "Valid" points on the website.
