title: How are rewards calculated? What if I find a block?
coin: xch
---

We use the PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares) method, which takes your share of the most recent work submitted to the pool to determine your reward when the pool earns a reward. The current value of "N" is shown under "Share Log Wipeout Duration" on the dashboard under Reward, and at the time of this FAQ it is 500k shares.

So if you have submitted 5k of the last 500k shares when a block is found, you would get 1%, or .0175 XCH, as your reward.

The farmer who "finds" a block for the pool is rewarded with 0.25 XCH "Farmer Reward" directly from the blockchain. This goes to your wallet automatically. The pool never touches that reward.
