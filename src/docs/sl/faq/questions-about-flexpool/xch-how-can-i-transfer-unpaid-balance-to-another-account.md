title: How can I transfer the unpaid balance to another acccount?
coin: xch

We do not process Chia unpaid balance transfers, as Chia does not have a digital signature option and payouts of a few cents each are not good for the Chia blockchain. You will need to farm to your old payout address until you earn the minimum payout of 0.01 XCH.
