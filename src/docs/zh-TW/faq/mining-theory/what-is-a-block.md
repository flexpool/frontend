At its most basic, a Block is a combination of the following elements:
| Block               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Transactions        | A list of a number of transactions from the network, the size of this list is limited so only a certain amount of transactions can be included (the amount of transactions able to be included varies by coin). Transactions also include a _Transaction Fee_ which is given to the miner of the Block in exchange for including that transaction in the Block, transactions are included in blocks based on these Transaction Fees, higher fees get incorporated in Blocks faster as the miners are trying to make as much profit as possible. The transactions list includes a special transaction which gives funds to the miner of the block, these funds are "created" when the Block is broadcast to the network and is known as the _Block Reward_. |
| Previous Block Hash | The Hash of the previous block on the blockchain - this ensures that the chain can't be changed, because adjusting anything in the previous blocks would result in this becoming invalid and cause the chain to break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Nonce               | 代表"一次使用的數字"，這是一個由礦工隨機猜測產生的數字，直到他們找到一個數字，當與其他區塊數據哈希時，產生一個所需難度（或更高）的哈希值，使區塊_有效_。 A Block which does not yet have a Nonce is called a _Block Template_, this can be repeatedly Hashed with different Nonces to try to meet the Difficulty requirement of the coin and form a Block. If two Blocks are found by different pools at the same time they are both added to the chain and then the next block will only point its Previous Block Hash at one of these, the other is called an _Uncle_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
