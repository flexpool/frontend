You need the Chia Blockchain software from Chia Network. You can find the latest version on [https://chia.net](https://chia.net) . You should always run the latest version, and check for updates regularly.

You may want to use third party software like the [Madmax plotter](https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter) (sponsored by Flexpool) or [Bladebit](https://github.com/harold-b/bladebit) plotter, or plot managers like [Plotman](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman) and [Swar](https://github.com/swar/Swar-Chia-Plot-Manager). These are optional, but many Chia farmers find them useful. Please note that we do not provide official support for these software programs, but there are lots of users in our Telegram and Discord who may be able to help you out with them. Again, you should always run the latest version, and check for updates regularly.

You may also wish to check out Flexpool's optional, proprietary, optimized farmer software called FlexFarmer. See our [Getting Started](https://www.flexpool.io/get-started) page or our [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flexpool/comments/p4apo2/flexfarmer_v10_release_nodeless_farming_on/) for more details. Not surprisingly, you should always run the latest version, and check for updates regularly.
