This is almost always a farmer-side issue, and is often caused by a flaky network (wifi with high interference, for example), heavy load on the farmer (from plotting or moving plots around), or sometimes a suboptimal connection between you and the pool. Unlike ETH, Chia is not as susceptible to latency to the pool server, so while you can change servers to try to work around this, it's usually not an Internet path issue. Even 400ms latency to the pool server is usually acceptable.
