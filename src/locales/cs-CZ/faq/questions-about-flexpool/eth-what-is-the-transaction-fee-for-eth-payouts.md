For mainnet payouts (the default), you pay the current gas fee at the time of a payout cycle, if it is below your gas price limit. The price varies, but it is a fixed fee regardless of your payout amount. As an estimate, 100 Gwei would be 0.0021 ETH.

For polygon WETH payouts, the fee is US$0.02 which covers the pool's costs in converting and transmitting the payouts.

These fees are deducted before the payment reaches your wallet.
