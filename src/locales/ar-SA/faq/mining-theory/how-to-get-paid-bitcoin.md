Flexpool provides a unique opportunity for you to mine and receive Bitcoin, simply mine to your Bitcoin address. Payouts occur each Bitcoin round when your payout reaches your limit. Currently only Iron Fish mining is supported
Here's how it works: Each day, Flexpool runs a Bitcoin round where each miner is paid out if they have reached their limit. A 1% fee is charged for this service, most of which goes towards covering our costs such as transaction or exchange fees.
To connect to the pool with a Bitcoin address, simply use this format: btc:mybitcoinaddress where you would normally enter your wallet address in your mining program.
An example is `btc:bc1qnkyhslv83yxxxxuj3lg9drgqq9c0auzc`
You can also use this btc wallet address to view your dashboard. Enjoy mining with Flexpool!

So, an example address would be: `btc:bc1qnkyhslv83yyp0q0suxw0uj3lg9drgqq9c0auzc`.
