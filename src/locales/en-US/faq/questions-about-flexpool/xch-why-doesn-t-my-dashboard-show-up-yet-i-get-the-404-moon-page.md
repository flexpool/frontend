Our dashboards activate within 20 minutes of your first valid partial being submitted to the pool. For farmers with 150 or more plots, this should mean your dashboard shows up and your worker is consistently active on it within 20 minutes. For farmers with fewer plots, it will take longer, and you may appear offline. With one plot, you might wait 6 hours and you might only appear online 10 times a day.
