Our pool only pays rewards when we earn rewards. If there are no blocks found for a period of time, there is no reward to share with farmers, so your rewards do not increase.

You can check the Blocks tab at the top of any of our pages to see when the last block was found. If there is a spinning wheel next to the block number, it is not yet confirmed and may not be finalized
yet. Sometimes blocks may take an hour to confirm and have a final reward value on your Rewards tab.
