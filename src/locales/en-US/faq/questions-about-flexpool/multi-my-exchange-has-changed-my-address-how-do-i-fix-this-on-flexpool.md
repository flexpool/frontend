You should first contact your exchange to see if the "old" wallet address can receive a last deposit and credit your account. Most exchanges do this for a time after changing the address. Some exchanges like Coinbase create a new address everytime you look up your "receive" address, but all past addresses are still linked to your account and can be used.

If you can receive a last deposit to the old address, stop mining to the old address immediately and contact support for help with getting a payout if your unpaid balance is at least 0.005 ETH.
