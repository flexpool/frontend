Not yet, although we have miners around the world who may be able to help you on Discord or Telegram at any time.

Our support team is online throughout the day though, so even if you see "Help" instead of "Chat" you can submit a request and will get an answer usually within several hours at most--sometimes within several minutes. Be sure to [ask your question and include your payout address](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flexpool/comments/p15yyn/getting_the_best_results_from_flexpool_support_or/) and any error messages you're getting. If you leave a message with just "Hi" we can't start helping you when our team is online.
