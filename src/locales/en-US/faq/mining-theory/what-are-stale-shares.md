Stale shares are shares that were sent to the pool after they were expired. This directly affects your profitability, and it is recommended to keep them as low as possible.

Normal stale rate is the stale rate below 1%. Everything above in unacceptable unless you are located far away from the closest Flexpool region.

Tips for reducing the stale rate:

* Use Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi.
* Use Cable/Fiber connection (not mobile).
* Make sure that you've disabled the Ethernet power save mode, if you have one enabled.

Things that cause stale shares:
* Latency between your worker and pool server
* Poor miner software
* Packet loss
* Jitter
