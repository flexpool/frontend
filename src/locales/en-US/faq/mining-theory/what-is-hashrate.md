title: 'What is Hashrate?'

Hashrate is a measure of the amount of Hashes your worker is processing per second - the higher your hashrate the more likely you are to find more Shares in a given amount of time.

Hashrates are measured using SI (Metric International System of Units) prefixes:

| Unit | Description                                                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| H/s  | Hashes per Second - Number of individual hashes each second                    |
| KH/s | KiloHashes per Second - Thousands of hashes each second, equal to 1000 H/s     |
| MH/s | MegaHashes per Second - Millions of hashes each second, equal to 1000 KH/s     |
| GH/s | GigaHashes per Second - Billions of hashes each second, equal to 1000 MH/s     |
| TH/s | TeraHashes per Second - Trillions of hashes each second, equal to 1000 GH/s    |
| PH/s | PetaHashes per Second - Quadrillions of hashes each second, equal to 1000 TH/s |
| ...  | And more                                                                       |

In your dashboard, you have three hashrates shown:

| Hashrate Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Effective             | The hashrate the pool thinks you have based on the amount of shares the pool is receiving from you, this can vary a lot over time due to Luck.                            |
| Average \[Effective\] | The rolling 24 hour average of your Effective hashrate, this should be close to your Reported Hashrate                                                                    |
| Reported              | The hashrate your mining software is reporting to the pool (this is not taken into account for calculating rewards but is shown for comparison to the Effective hashrate) |
