Flexpool provides a unique feature called autoswap for you to select any minable currency and connect your miners using a Bitcoin address. This way, your payouts are transferred into Bitcoin payment rounds.

Here's how it works: Each day, Flexpool collects all user payments and converts your selected coin into Bitcoin automatically. All fees related to depositing, swapping, and withdrawing from the exchange are covered by Flexpool. After the conversion is completed, we subtract a 1% fee to cover the operational costs of this service. The remaining Bitcoin is then distributed among users, sent to their respective Bitcoin addresses.

To connect to the pool with a Bitcoin address, simply use this format: btc:mybitcoinaddress. You can also use this same format to view your dashboard. Enjoy mining with Flexpool!
