If you have the keys or mnemonics (usually a 24 word recovery phrase), and if your unpaid balance on the "old" wallet is at least 0.01 ETH, you may sign an Ethereum digital message to authorize the transfer. Contact support for instructions.

This option is not available if you use a hosted wallet like Coinbase or Binance, since we have no way of verifying your ownership of an exchange or hosted wallet.
