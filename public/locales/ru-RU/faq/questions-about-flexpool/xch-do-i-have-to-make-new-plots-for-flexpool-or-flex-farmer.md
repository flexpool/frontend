If you are already pooling with an Official Protocol pool, you can use the same plots. Just use the Chia GUI to change pools, or the Chia CLI to leave the old pool and join Flexpool.

The official pooling protocol does not support OG plots (those made before Chia 1.2.0, with a -p plotter option rather than -c), so you cannot use OG plots with our pool or any Official Protocol pool. You may still farm them solo with the Chia software while farming new plots to Flexpool.

Our [Getting Started page](https://www.flexpool.io/get-started) includes instructions for creating plots that work with pools.
